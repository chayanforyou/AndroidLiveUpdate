## Live Updates Notification for Android 16 ðŸš€

Exploring the Next Evolution of Notifications

Android 16 introduces powerful new capabilities for apps to provide real-time, progress-focused notifications. With this, apps like ride-sharing, food delivery, or navigation can surface critical informationâ€”such as delivery status, ride ETA, or order progressâ€”without requiring the user to open the app.

This project demonstrates how to build Live Updates Notifications that make your app more interactive and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Progress-Focused Notifications** <br>
  Use Notification.ProgressStyle to show users live updates of key tasks, like ride arrival or food delivery progress.

- **Real-Time Updates** <br>
  Deliver critical information in real-time for journeys, deliveries, and ride-sharing experiences.

- **Enhanced User Experience** <br>
  Minimize unnecessary app interactions by surfacing relevant updates directly in notifications.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/live-updates-android16.git
```
2. Open in Android Studio and run on a device with Android 16 or higher.
3. Explore the sample notifications with `LiveUpdateSample` composable.

## Usage

Use the `Notification.ProgressStyle` API to create notifications that update dynamically:

```kotlin
val builder = Notification.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID)
    .setContentTitle("Delivery Progress")
    .setContentText("Your order is on the way!")
    .setProgress(maxValue, currentValue, false)
    .setOngoing(true)
```

Trigger updates through `SnackbarNotificationManager` or your own notification service to reflect real-time progress.
